PROBLEM

- In the expo-dev-client if you're using the eas build bareflow, icons other then 'react-native-vector-icons' do not work.
it seems like they aren't being register in the 'uimanager' with these error here: 'rnsvgpath was not found in the uimanager'
'rnsvgrect was not found in the uimanager react native'.

SOLUTION

- After many attempts and tries of other solutions, it look like the onnly way to bypass this issue is to place the content in a stack nativigator, which will then allow you to display the icon but they still will not be verified.
- If you'd like to use a dev-client I recommend using expo-go then when ready to make the build to push your update over the air 
so you're able to test the app to see if it works properly.
